## Welcome to my portfolio website!

#### This portfolio website uses only HTML, CSS, and some Javascript.

#### Before making this website I researched a ton of other people's portfolio website's in order to get a basic understanding of what type of format I wanted to use. For the the navigation bar I used a code along tutorial on youtube. I liked the concept of having a burger that changed to an "X" to close and created a drop down menu. I also followed a tutorial on youtube to make the "Typing text" featured on my "Home" and "About Me" sections of the website. Both tutorials introduced me to javascript, and helped me learn tips and tricks to set up the remainder of my site. For everything else in the site I used w3schools and many other sites to help assist me put together the vision I created in my head. I have one project linked on the website under the "Work" section. This is a mini-project that was assigned in class. Hopefully I can fill the rest of the "coming soon" placeholders with new projects in the future. All of the buttons work so try them out, including the "download resume" button! Enjoy my portfolio website!
